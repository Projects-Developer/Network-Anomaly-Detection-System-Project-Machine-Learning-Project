## Abstract: 
The Network Anomaly Detection System (NADS) is an advanced security mechanism designed to monitor and identify irregular patterns or activities within a network that deviate from the established norms, which could indicate potential security threats such as intrusion, malware, or denial of service attacks. By leveraging machine learning, statistical analysis, and data mining techniques, NADS can efficiently detect previously unknown or evolving network anomalies. The system analyzes traffic data, such as packet flow, network behavior, and communication patterns, to identify suspicious activities in real-time. Anomalies are flagged based on a variety of factors, including unusual bandwidth usage, unexpected traffic bursts, or unknown protocols. The system reduces the reliance on signature-based detection methods, providing a proactive defense against zero-day attacks and minimizing false positives through adaptive learning and continuous updates. NADS plays a critical role in safeguarding network infrastructure by enhancing security postures and enabling rapid response to emerging threats. This paper explores the architecture, techniques, and challenges associated with the implementation and effectiveness of the Network Anomaly Detection System.
